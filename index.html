      <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
      <p>
        C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create
        high-performance applications. <br />C++ was developed by Bjarne
        Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. <br />C++ gives
        programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
        <br />The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020,
        and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23.
      </p>
      <h3>Features of C++</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Simple: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be <br>
          broken down into logical units and parts, and has a rich library <br>
          support and a variety of datatypes <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Machine Independent: C++ code can be run on any machine as long as a <br>
          suitable compiler is provided. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Low-level Access: C++ provides low-level access to system resources,<br>
          which makes it a suitable choice for system programming and writing <br>
          efficient code. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Fast Execution Speed: C++ is one of the fastest high-level <br>
          There is no additional processing overhead in C++, it is blazing fast. <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Object-Oriented: One of the strongest points of the language which <br>
          sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make <br>
          maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. large-scale applications
          can be built. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Introduction to Arrays</h2>
      <h3>What is an Array ?</h3>
      <p>
        Array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored
        at contiguous memory locations. It is one of the most popular and simple
        data structures used in programming. In an array, all the elements are
        stored in contiguous memory locations. So, if we initialize an array,
        the elements will be allocated sequentially in memory. This allows for
        efficient access and manipulation of elements.
      </p>

      <h3>Characteristics of an Array :</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fixed Size: The size of an array is defined at the time of its
          creation and cannot be changed during runtime.
        </li>
        <li>
          Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array are of the same data
          type (e.g., all integers, all floats, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          Indexed Access: Elements in an array are accessed using indices,
          starting from 0 for the first element.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contiguous Memory Allocation: Array elements are stored in consecutive
          memory locations, which allows for efficient access and iteration.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2>Introduction to Trees</h2>
      <p>
        Tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to
        represent and organize data in the form of parent child relationship.
        The following are some real world situations which are naturally a tree.

      <h3>Types of Trees</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Binary tree:In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two
          children linked to it. Some common types of binary trees include full
          binary trees, complete binary trees, balanced binary trees, and
          degenerate or pathological binary trees. Examples of Binary Tree are
          Binary Search Tree and Binary Heap.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ternary Tree: A Ternary Tree is a tree data structure in which each
          node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as “left”,
          “mid” and “right”.
        </li>
        <li>
          N-ary Tree:Generic trees are a collection of nodes where each node is
          a data structure that consists of records and a list of references to
          its children(duplicate references are not allowed). Unlike the linked
          list, each node stores the address of multiple nodes.

      <h2>Introduction to Graphs</h2>
      <p>
        Graph Data Structure is a non-linear data structure consisting of
        vertices and edges. It is useful in fields such as social network
        analysis, recommendation systems, and computer networks. In the field of
        sports data science, graph data structure can be used to analyze and
        understand the dynamics of team performance and player interactions on
        the field.

      <h3>What is Graph data structure ?</h3>
      <p>
        Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.
        The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are
        lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a
        Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The
        graph is denoted by G(V, E). Imagine a game of football as a web of
        connections, where players are the nodes and their interactions on the
        field are the edges. This web of connections is exactly what a graph
        data structure represents, and it's the key to unlocking insights into
        team performance and player dynamics in sports.
